    <script>
        let num1 = prompt("Enter the first number:");
        let num2 = prompt("Enter the second number:");
        let sum = Number(num1) + Number(num2);
        console.log(`The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${sum}.`);
        alert(`The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${sum}.`);

    </script>

    In this example, the prompt() method is used to ask the user for two numbers, and the values entered by the user are
    stored in the num1 and num2 variables. The Number() method is used to convert the values entered by the user to
    numbers, and the sum of the two numbers is calculated and stored in the sum variable. The console.log() method is
    used to print a message to the console, and the alert() method is used to display a message in an alert box.

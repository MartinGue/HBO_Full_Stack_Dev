</head>

<body>
    The outer loop counts up from outer 1 to outer 4. For every iteration of the outer loop, the inner
    loop counts up from innerNumber1 to innerNumber5. This means that it starts in the first iteration with outer = 1
    and innerNumber 1, producing the following output:   
    << 1 multiplied by 1 is 1
    
    <br>
    <p id="text"></p>


    In the next iteration, we are still inside the inner loop, so n remains as 1, but m is
    incremented to 2, giving:
    
    << 1 multiplied by 2 is 2

    <br>
    
    m continues to increase until it reaches 5. After this, we leave the inner loop and return to
    the outer loop, where outer increases to 2. We then re-enter the inner loop and innerNumber is reset back
    to 1 and begins counting up to 5 again. This continues until the last iteration produces the
    line:
   
    << innerNumber 5 multiplied by outer 4 is 20

        for (var outer = 1; outer <= 4; outer++) {
          textElement.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Outer Loop Number " + outer + ":"));
          textElement.appendChild(document.createElement("br"));
          
          for (var inner = 1; inner <= 5; inner++) {
            var resultText ="innerNumber" + inner + " multiplied by outer " + outer + " is " + outer * inner;
            var lineBreak = document.createElement("br");
            textElement.appendChild(document.createTextNode(resultText));
            textElement.appendChild(lineBreak);
          }
        }

        let age = prompt("What is your age?");

            alert("Please enter a valid number.");
        } else if (age < 18) {
            console.log("You are not old enough to vote.");
            alert("You are not old enough to vote.");

    In this example, the prompt() method is used to ask the user for their age, and the value entered by the user is
    stored in the age variable. The isNaN() method is used to check if the value entered by the user is not a number,
    and if it is not a number, an appropriate error message is displayed using console.log() and alert(). If the value
    entered by the user is a number, it is evaluated to see if the user is old enough to vote, and an appropriate
    message is displayed using console.log() and alert().

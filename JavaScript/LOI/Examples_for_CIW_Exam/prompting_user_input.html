        let name = prompt("What is your name?");
        console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
        alert(`Welcome, ${name}!`);
    </script>

    In this example, the prompt() method is used to ask the user for their name, and the value entered by the user is
    stored in the name variable. The console.log() method is used to print a message to the console, and the alert()
    method is used to display a message in an alert box.
